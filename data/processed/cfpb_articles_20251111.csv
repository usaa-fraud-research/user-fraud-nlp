Wise allows customers to send, receive, and store remittances through a mobile app and prepaid accounts and debit cards. The CFPB initiated an administrative action that found the company misled customers in the United States about its ATM fees and failed to properly disclose other fees. When people sent money that did not arrive on time, Wise failed to refund the remittance fees in the timeframe required by law. Wise PLC (LON: WISE) is a publicly traded global electronic money services provider. It is headquartered in the United Kingdom, and does business in the United States through Wise US, a wholly owned subsidiary. Wise US is a nonbank remittance transfer provider headquartered in New York and incorporated in Delaware. Wise US offers and provides consumers international money transfer services, known as remittance transfers, in 48 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Wise US has more than three million customers in the U.S. Wise does not have any physical storefronts in the U.S., and instead relies on a mobile app, along with its prepaid and debit cards. Wise offers U.S. consumers two products: Send Money (remittance transfers through its mobile app) and the Wise Account (a prepaid account product). Wise maintains U.S. bank accounts, which allows it to process transfers for U.S. customers by transferring funds from the United States to foreign countries and vice versa. Wise also facilitates transfers by U.S. customers that occur entirely outside of the United States. On the prepaid card, customers can store and send money in multiple currencies. A third product, a debit card, allows customers to spend money stored on the prepaid account. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including by engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB also has the authority to enforce the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and its implementing Regulation E, including the Prepaid Rule and the Remittance Transfer Rule. The CFPB’s January 30, 2025 Consent Order required Wise to: Pay approximately $450,000 to harmed consumers to resolve claims, including that the company’s prepaid card violations resulted in at least 16,000 consumers being overcharged. Pay a $2.025 million fine to the CFPB’s victims relief fund . The May 15, 2025 Amended Consent Order supersedes the January 30, 2025 Consent Order and requires Wise to redress the harm to consumers and to pay a revised fine of approximately $45,000 in accordance with relevant law. The Amended Consent Order aligns the civil penalty with applicable provisions of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, 12 U.S.C. § 5565(a)(2)(H), (c)(4), relevant precedents for the conduct and cooperation at issue, the terms of Executive Order 14219 (Feb. 19, 2025), and the Bureau’s rescission of certain guidance including Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2024-02: Deceptive marketing practices about the speed or cost of sending a remittance transfer, 89 FR 27357 (Apr. 17, 2024).

www.consumerfinance.gov,2025-01-30,CFPB Updates List of Consumer Reporting Companies,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-updates-list-of-consumer-reporting-companies/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released its annual list of consumer reporting companies. The list identifies dozens of specialty reporting companies that collect and sell access to people’s data, including individuals’ finances, employment, check writing histories, or rental history records. People can use the list to, among other things, request their consumer reporting data, dispute inaccuracies, and block access to their credit reporting data through security freezes. The list also informs consumers about the types of personal financial information that is collected for credit and other consumer reports. “The number of companies and industries gathering, selling, and using personal financial data continues to rise,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “The CFPB’s consumer reporting company list helps consumers know who is collecting and selling their data, along with the steps they can take to freeze their reports.” In the United States, personal financial data is used by a variety of entities when making lending, banking, employment, and housing decisions. Some less obvious entities that use personal financial data include casinos, phone companies, volunteer organizations, government agencies determining eligibility for assistance programs, debt collectors, and insurance companies. While three nationwide consumer reporting companies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – dominate much of the credit reporting market, many specialty consumer reporting companies exist to support different industries. This means consumers’ personal financial data may be collected by and reported to a multitude of companies and individuals. That spread can also increase consumer risk, especially when consumers are unaware that it is happening. The annual list of consumer reporting companies published by the CFPB allows people to find consumer reporting companies that provide specialized reporting for specific markets that might be relevant to them depending on their specific goals and situation. The list also provides information on how people can dispute inaccurate information and request a security freeze. A security freeze blocks third-party access to personal credit reporting data. It is the only solution available for free by law that can prevent scammers from opening new credit accounts in your name in situations where credit reports are a prerequisite to lending. People reported losing more than $10 billion to fraud in 2023, an increase of 14% over the previous year, according to the Federal Trade Commission . This number captures only the initial dollar amount lost. Other key information in today’s report includes: Consumer reporting companies that share information with casinos are included: Casinos and sports betting apps are dependent on digital access to consumer cash information. This year’s list of consumer reporting companies includes those that provide data to casinos and sports betting companies. Social media, driving data, and other unexpected information can be part of certain consumer reports: Employment screening reports can include social media data. Consumer reporting companies will also sell driving behavior data to auto insurers, collected through drivers’ mobile phones or motor vehicles, to determine auto insurance eligibility and rates. Other data may include property insurance claims, drug and alcohol testing and health screening information, and non-profit and volunteer activity verification. Under many circumstances, people can receive their credit reports for free: The bigger nationwide companies must provide a free report no less than once every twelve months upon request. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, they have chosen to make free reports available to consumers weekly. Additionally, consumer reporting companies must provide a free copy of a person’s report, upon request, if an adverse action, like being denied credit or housing, is taken against the individual. For other requests, consumer reporting companies must provide consumers’ copies of their information for a reasonable fee (for calendar year 2025, the maximum allowable fee is $15.50). Requesting copies of their consumer reports does not harm consumers’ credit scores. Hard inquiries can lower credit scores: Applications for credit and leasing can result in a “hard inquiry” on applicants’ credit reports. This can lower applicants’ credit scores because most credit scores look at how recently and how frequently they have applied for credit. Likewise, tenants shopping around for rental housing, who are submitting multiple lease applications with different landlords, may be subjected to multiple hard inquiries. Bank account history can affect access to credit: While not credit history, deposit account history may be used by lenders to determine credit eligibility and pricing, especially for loan applicants with little to no credit history. Negative deposit information can include an unpaid negative balance, the bank closing an individual’s account, or the account being associated with fraud.

www.consumerfinance.gov,2025-01-17,CFPB Orders Equifax to Pay $15 Million for Improper Investigations of Credit Reporting Errors,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-equifax-to-pay-15-million-for-improper-investigations-of-credit-reporting-errors/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) took action against Equifax, the nationwide consumer reporting agency, for its failure to conduct proper investigations of consumer disputes. The CFPB found Equifax ignored consumer documents and evidence submitted with disputes, allowed previously deleted inaccuracies to be reinserted into credit reports, provided confusing and conflicting letters to consumers about the results of its investigations, and used flawed software code which led to inaccurate consumer credit scores. The order requires Equifax to comply with federal law, and Equifax must pay a $15 million civil money penalty, which will be deposited into the CFPB’s victims relief fund. “Equifax failed in its basic duty to investigate and resolve consumer disputes about inaccurate information on their credit reports,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “Today’s order requires Equifax to pay a civil penalty and follow federal laws on handling credit reporting disputes.” Equifax Inc. (NYSE: EFX) is a nationwide consumer reporting agency with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Equifax is the parent company to Equifax Information Services LLC, and is one of the three major consumer reporting agencies in the United States. It aggregates data about most adult consumers and sells that data to its customers in the form of consumer reports that are used by lenders, employers, landlords, and others to make important decisions about consumers. Equifax processes approximately 765,000 disputes each month. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires consumer reporting agencies to investigate the accuracy of disputed information and take steps to ensure consumers’ credit reports are accurate. For example, consumer reporting agencies must provide notice of a consumer dispute to the furnisher who provided the disputed information, conduct reasonable investigations to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate, and provide the results of the investigation to the consumer. The CFPB found Equifax violated the FCRA’s requirements for investigating and processing consumer disputes and assuring maximum possible accuracy of information on its consumer reports. The CFPB also found that Equifax violated the law by using ineffective systems and flawed processes, and excessively deferring to furnishers to address disputes. Specifically, the CFPB found Equifax harmed consumers by: Failing to thoroughly investigate consumer disputes : Equifax’s process for submitting disputes limits the ability of consumers to fully and accurately describe their disputes. In many cases, Equifax also failed to consider relevant information submitted by consumers, sometimes not looking at the information at all. Then, after Equifax forwarded information about a dispute to a furnisher, it did not meaningfully consider whether the furnisher’s response made sense, sometimes ignoring information it had that contradicted the furnisher’s response. Finally, the resulting letters Equifax sent to consumers sometimes contained confusing or contradictory statements, such as both “this has been verified as accurate” and “this item has been deleted.” Putting previously deleted errors back on credit reports and failing to block identity- theft related information : Equifax did not have systems to detect information that was previously removed and block that information from again appearing on the consumer’s credit report. In addition, Equifax also had no process to identify situations where a consumer is forced to send another dispute about the same inaccurate information because Equifax failed to correct the information the first time, or because Equifax reported information that had previously been corrected. Equifax’s policies limited consumers’ ability to dispute inaccurate information being put on their credit report. Finally, Equifax reported credit information that it should have blocked because the information resulted from identity theft. Sharing inaccurate credit scores and data about consumers with lenders: Coding errors in Equifax’s internal software caused the company to miscalculate and share inaccurate credit scores for several hundred thousand consumers. The company also reported the same credit accounts multiple times for more than 50,000 consumers. Enforcement Action Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including the FCRA, and the prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices under the CFPA. The order requires Equifax to: Follow federal law on handling credit reporting data : Equifax must bring its dispute resolution processes into compliance with the FCRA and CFPA.

www.consumerfinance.gov,2025-01-17,CFPB Orders Honda’s Auto Financing Arm to Pay $12.8 Million for COVID-19 and Other Credit Reporting Failures,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-hondas-auto-financing-arm-to-pay-128-million-for-covid-19-and-other-credit-reporting-failures/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today ordered the American Honda Finance Corporation to pay $12.8 million for reporting inaccurate information that affected the credit reports of 300,000 people who drive Honda and Acura vehicles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Honda Finance deferred certain vehicle loan payments. However, the CFPB found that the company told credit reporting companies that borrowers were delinquent when they should have been reported as current. The CFPB’s investigation also found multiple other credit furnishing accuracy and dispute investigation failures. The CFPB is ordering the company to pay $10.3 million in redress to harmed customers and to pay a $2.5 million civil money penalty. “Honda Finance used sloppy practices that smeared the credit reports of hundreds of thousands of its customers,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “False accusations on a credit report can have serious implications for Americans seeking a job, housing, or a loan.” Honda Finance is a nonbank automotive finance company for American Honda Motor Co., Inc., which is the sole authorized distributor of Honda and Acura motor vehicles in the United States. Honda Finance is headquartered in Torrance, California. Honda Finance is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Honda Motor. Honda Finance’s primary business is the purchase and servicing of loans and leases arranged by Honda and Acura dealerships. As part of their business, Honda sends data about borrowers that appears on their credit reports. The CFPB found that Honda Finance violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Honda Finance furnished false and harmful information that ended up on borrowers’ credit reports. The company also failed to conduct appropriate investigations of customer disputes. Specifically, the company harmed consumers by: Damaging borrowers’ credit reports during a national emergency : During the COVID-19 crisis, Honda Finance allowed consumers to defer payments and promised to continue reporting those consumers as current to credit reporting companies. Instead, Honda Finance reported those consumers as delinquent when they did not make payments that were not required during the deferral period. Further, Honda Finance continued furnishing inaccurate information even after determining several types of information was inaccurate. These actions harmed approximately 300,000 consumers. Failing to investigate disputes : Honda Finance failed to properly investigate disputes about information it furnished to credit reporting companies. Additionally, they failed to send the results of investigations to credit reporting companies and consumers, when required. Enforcement Action Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including those violating the Fair Credit Report Act and engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB’s order requires Honda Finance to: Pay $10.3 million to harmed consumers: Honda Finance must pay $10.3 million in redress to consumers and take steps to correct its prior erroneous reporting. Pay a $2.5 million fine: Honda will pay a $2.5 million penalty to the CFPB’s victims relief fund . Read today's order . The CFPB has taken a previous enforcement action against Honda Finance. In 2015, the CFPB and Department of Justice took action against Honda Finance for illegal discrimination. The company charged African American, Hispanic, and Asian and Pacific Islander borrowers higher dealer markups for their auto loans than non-Hispanic white borrowers. These markups were without regard to the creditworthiness of the borrowers. Honda Finance agreed to pay $24 million in redress for violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The CFPB has also taken a series of actions to ensure that credit reports are accurate and that consumers can dispute false information. The CFPB issued orders against two other vehicle finance subsidiaries, Hyundai and Toyota . The CFPB has also ordered Equifax to pay $15 million for failing to conduct adequate investigations of disputed information in credit reports. Earlier this month, the CFPB sued Experian for not properly investigating disputes and failing to remove errors on consumers’ credit reports.

Equifax collects and organizes data on most adult Americans to generate consumer reports, which it sells to creditors and other businesses that evaluate whether to offer consumers loans, jobs, housing, and certain other products. To promote the accuracy and fairness of information in consumer reports, the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives consumers the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information in their credit file and requires consumer reporting agencies, like Equifax, to forward notice of the dispute to the company that originally provided the information (called the “furnisher”). FCRA also requires consumer reporting agencies to reinvestigate such disputes and remove or correct any inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. The Bureau found that Equifax violated FCRA, including by failing to properly conduct reinvestigations of disputed information in consumer files; failing to prevent the improper reinsertion of previously deleted information from consumer files; failing to provide adequate written notice to consumers of the results of its reinvestigations; failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of information Equifax reports on consumers; and failing to block reporting of information consumers identified as resulting from identity theft and to provide appropriate notice when such blocks were declined or rescinded. The Bureau also found that Equifax engaged in unfair acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 by: (1) using ineffective systems, flawed processes, and excessive deference to furnishers to resolve consumer disputes and failing to adequately inform consumers of the results of reinvestigations; and (2) selling inaccurate consumer credit scores and credit attributes after it introduced “test code” into a production environment in a scoring model server.

www.consumerfinance.gov,2025-01-16,CFPB Orders Operator of Cash App to Pay $175 Million and Fix Its Failures on Fraud,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-operator-of-cash-app-to-pay-175-million-and-fix-its-failures-on-fraud/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) ordered Block, the operator of the peer-to-peer payments app Cash App, to refund and pay other redress to consumers up to $120 million and pay a penalty of $55 million into the CFPB’s victims relief fund. Block employed weak security protocols for Cash App and put its users at risk. While Block is required by law to investigate and resolve disputes about unauthorized transactions, the company’s investigations were woefully incomplete. Block directed users — who had suffered financial losses as a result of fraud — to ask their bank to attempt to reverse transactions, which Block would subsequently deny. Block also deployed a range of tactics to suppress Cash App users from seeking help, reducing its own costs. “Cash App created the conditions for fraud to proliferate on its popular payment platform,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “When things went wrong, Cash App flouted its responsibilities and even burdened local banks with problems that the company caused.” Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) is a publicly traded corporation whose principal executive offices are in Oakland, California. Block offers multiple digital payments products for businesses and consumers, including the point-of-sale payment system Square and the consumer payment service Cash App. Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the United States, with more than 56 million accounts. It allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers; accept direct deposits; and use a prepaid card, Cash Card, to make purchases and ATM withdrawals. Block made approximately $7.5 billion in gross profit in 2023, approximately $4 billion of which was generated by Cash App. Cash App attempted to avoid many of its investigative obligations through tricking consumers with its Terms of Service. For example, many Cash App users link their bank account to the app. When a transaction occurs, the money is pulled from the user’s bank account and sent to the transaction recipient. In Cash App’s Terms of Service, consumers are led to believe that disputes are the responsibility of their linked bank. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act generally requires that peer-to-peer platforms, including Cash App, investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions, and a company cannot simply use fine print to escape these legal requirements. When it did conduct investigations, Block used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company’s favor. Block also deprived Cash App users of meaningful and effective customer service and left the network vulnerable to criminals defrauding users. While Block included a telephone number on the back of its Cash Card and in its Cash App Terms of Service, for many years this telephone number did not connect consumers to customer support of any type. Instead, it led to a pre-recorded message directing consumers to contact customer support through the app. Consumers could only contact Block through the app or through U.S. mail and were often met with delayed, inadequate, confusing, or inaccurate responses. Consumers looking for an alternate route to Cash App customer service through web searches were targeted by fraudsters posing as Cash App representatives, who tricked them into giving up their passwords and other personal information. Block knew that its customers were being targeted by fraudsters in this way but failed to take timely action to address the issue. Enforcement Action Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including those engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB also has the authority to enforce the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. The CFPB’s order requires Block to: Pay $120 million to harmed consumers: Block is required to pay up to $120 million in refunds and other redress to consumers whose unauthorized transfers were not investigated, consumers who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, and consumers whose accounts were locked for an extended period of time or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation. Block must pay a minimum amount of $75 million in refunds and other redress. The CFPB will enforce the order’s redress requirements to ensure affected Cash App users receive redress. Consumers will not need to take action at this time to obtain redress. Fix customer service and investigate disputes: To ensure that the misconduct does not recur, the order requires Block to set up 24-hour, live-person customer service. The order also requires Block to fully investigate unauthorized transactions and to provide timely refunds, where appropriate. Pay a $55 million fine: Block will pay a $55 million penalty to the CFPB’s victims relief fund . The CFPB order only addresses violations of consumer financial protection laws under the CFPB’s purview. Yesterday, state regulators separately ordered Block to pay $80 million for Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering law violations. Read today’s order . The CFPB has taken a range of steps to ensure that popular payment apps and services, including those offered by large technology companies, are following federal law. In November, the CFPB finalized a rule that will subject large nonbank payment platforms to similar oversight that large banks face. Last month, the CFPB sued Early Warning Services, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo for allowing fraud to fester on Zelle.

www.consumerfinance.gov,2025-01-16,CFPB Takes Action to Address Illegal Debt Collection Practices by the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-to-address-illegal-debt-collection-practices-by-the-national-collegiate-student-loan-trusts/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) took action to resolve its case against the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts for unlawfully filing defective debt collection lawsuits to collect on private student loan debt. The CFPB and the Trusts filed a proposed stipulated judgment that, if entered by the court, would require the Trusts to pay $2.25 million in redress to student borrowers who were harmed. Today’s action follows a March 2024 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that the Trusts are covered persons under the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts had previously claimed that, as trusts, they were not covered under the Consumer Financial Protection Act. In December, the Supreme Court declined to hear the Trusts' appeal, leaving the Third Circuit decision in place. During the leadup to the financial crisis, there was a boom in subprime-style student lending. Student lenders worked with investment bankers to turn student loans into securities. The National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts are an example of this. The Trusts are a group of fifteen securitization trusts organized under Delaware law that acquire, pool, and securitize student loans, which they then service. In 2017, the CFPB filed a lawsuit alleging that the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts, among other things, brought improper debt collection lawsuits. Specifically, the CFPB alleges that the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts’ subservicers, acting on behalf of the Trusts: Sued consumers for debts the Trusts could not prove were owed: The Trusts unlawfully filed thousands of cases although they did not have or could not find the documentation necessary to prove either that they own the loans or that the consumer owed the debt. Filed false and misleading affidavits: In numerous instances, affiants claimed personal knowledge of the student loan debt they did not have. In some cases, the Trusts misrepresented that affidavits were properly notarized when they were, in fact, not. Attempted to collect after the statute of limitations expired: The Trusts unlawfully misrepresented that they had a right to collect time-barred debts after the statutes of limitations had expired. The CFPB also alleges that the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts engaged in unfair practices by filing collections lawsuits without the intent or ability to prove the claims, if contested. Enforcement Action Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating consumer financial protection laws, including by engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB’s order, if entered by the court, requires National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts to: Pay $2.25 million redress to consumers: The funds will be paid to the CFPB for the purpose of providing relief to borrowers who were harmed. Stop collecting on certain debts covered by the lawsuit: The Trusts must take steps to end certain pending debt collection lawsuits involving time-barred debt or where necessary documentation cannot be located, and to otherwise cease debt collection activities related to debt identified in those lawsuits.

www.consumerfinance.gov,2025-01-14,Strengthening State-Level Consumer Protections,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/strengthening-state-level-consumer-protections/,"Consumer protection law has long been a core part of keeping markets fair and competitive. And the consumer protection framework has always been a partnership between the federal government and the states. As our markets change, our federal and state laws must keep pace to deal with predatory practices, new actors, and other risks. Today, the CFPB released a report on how states can ensure their laws and regulations meet new consumer protection challenges, as well as a compendium of guidance documents that the CFPB has issued in recent years to address emerging challenges in the market for consumer financial products or services. Many states have led the way on ensuring protections remain robust and relevant to modern schemes that take advantage of consumers, workers, small business owners, and others. For example, states have addressed large companies’ increased harvesting and monetizing of sensitive data and ensured that financial institutions' lending, services, and investment activities meet the credit needs of their communities. It is critically important for policymakers to make sure that all state consumer protections are up to the task of dealing with new challenges. Today’s report includes recommendations to states on how they can update their laws and regulations to meet evolving risks. The report includes potential legislative text to help states address common schemes in the modern economy, such as junk fees and abuse of sensitive personal data; authorize representative private claims to ensure viability of private enforcement; ban “abusive” practices in state law to prevent companies from obscuring product features or exploiting their market power; and more. Many of these suggestions mirror the recent work the CFPB has done to empower consumers and level the playing field for companies of all sizes. The CFPB has worked closely with states in the last few years to ensure they have the information and support they need to carry out their duties and enforce the law. The CFPB has filed suits with state attorneys general against companies whose illegal practices cross state lines . The CFPB has pushed back on unwarranted preemption of state laws, including in credit reporting and small business lending . The CFPB has ensured that state enforcement agencies can make greatest possible use of their authority to directly enforce the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The CFPB also shares consumer complaints with cities, counties, and states. Today’s report builds on decades of federal government work with state and local law enforcement to police unfair and deceptive acts or practices and directly assisting states in developing their own legislation and enforcement programs. For instance, the FTC released a model Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act in 1967, which was rapidly adopted by states. The compendium that the CFPB issued today contains guidance documents regarding the federal consumer financial protection laws that the CFPB has released in the last several years due to the evolution in the consumer financial markets. Congress spread enforcement responsibility for these laws among a large set of federal and state government agencies, including state law enforcement and regulators. These guidance documents reflect the considered judgment, reasoning, knowledge, and expertise of the CFPB. Read the report.

(collectively, Capital One). Defendants are incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Virginia. The Bureau alleges that from 2013 to 2019, Capital One represented to consumers that its 360 Savings account was a “high interest” account with a variable rate that was “one of the nation’s” “top,” “best,” and “highest,” and would earn much more interest than the average savings or money market account. The Bureau alleges that these representations were false or otherwise misleading and that from December 2020 to at least August 2024, Capital One has kept the 360 Savings interest rate fixed at 0.30%, a rate that falls far short of the level represented in its marketing. The Bureau further alleges that Capital One made representations that created the net impression that its 360 Savings product was and would be its only 360 high interest savings product with the features, terms, and conditions of 360 Savings, but in 2019, Capital One stopped offering 360 Savings accounts to new customers and started offering a new high-interest savings product called “360 Performance Savings.” This new product had all the same terms and conditions as 360 Savings accounts, and Capital One likewise marketed it as having “one of the nation’s top savings rates.” But in contrast to the 360 Savings rate, Capital One has kept the 360 Performance Savings rate at a consistently high level. In August 2024, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times higher than the 360 Savings rate. Capital One did not convert 360 Savings accounts into 360 Performance Savings accounts and instead took steps to obscure from 360 Savings accountholders the fact that these were different products. The Bureau alleges that by misrepresenting the interest rate for the 360 Savings product, Capital One violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010’s (CFPA) prohibition on deceptive acts and practices; and Capital One, N.A. violated the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD. The Bureau also alleges that Capital One violated the CFPA’s prohibition on deceptive acts and practices by misrepresenting that 360 Savings was and would be its only high-interest savings product and the CFPA’s prohibition on abusive acts and practices by taking unreasonable advantage of 360 Savings account holders’ lack of understanding of the material risks and costs of the 360 Savings product. The Bureau seeks, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent future violations and monetary relief in the form of redress to consumers and the imposition of civil money penalties.

www.consumerfinance.gov,2025-01-02,Protecting you from unlawful debt collection at work,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/protecting-you-from-unlawful-debt-collection-at-work/,"Dealing with debt collection can be a source of significant stress for many people trying to navigate an already challenging financial landscape. Unscrupulous companies may use aggressive tactics to collect debts, including contacting people in the workplace, which can be illegal. This can threaten your employment or put pressure on you to pay debts even if you don’t actually owe them. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) continues to crack down on companies that harass consumers, including by unlawfully contacting their employers. In 2014, the CFPB with the states of North Carolina and Virginia got millions of dollars of relief from a debt collector that illegally contacted the commanding officers of members of the military to pressure them to pay. In 2018, the CFPB ordered a debt collector to pay a $5 million penalty for unfair practices that included contacting consumers at work even after being told they were not allowed to do so and disclosing information to employers about peoples’ alleged debts. CFPB examiners recently found that one or more companies unfairly called peoples’ references and places of employment after people asked them to stop or abusively included language in their loan applications that suggested people had consented to workplace calls that were actually illegal. Law enforcement officials at the federal and state level that enforce the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), state or federal prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and similar laws should be on the lookout for companies that contact people at work to try and coerce them to pay debts, including debts they don’t actually owe. The CFPB is also concerned that companies are exploiting an outdated provision of the FDCPA that allows debt collectors to contact third parties for the purpose of obtaining “location information,” including “place of employment.” Congress should consider repealing this provision, which some courts been interpreted to mean that debt collectors can contact your employer. In a world where so many people have cell phones, companies don’t often need to contact your employer to find you. In fact, companies may be calling you at work (or threatening to do so) when the real point is to embarrass, pressure, or otherwise coerce you to pay. There are several actions that you can take to protect yourself from unwanted debt collection in the workplace: 1) Tell them to stop contacting you at work . The FDCPA and similar provisions prohibit debt collectors from communicating with you at your place of employment if they know or have reason to know that your employer prohibits you from receiving such communications. Collectors are also prohibited from contacting you at a place they know or should know is inconvenient for you. 2) Demand that they stop contacting you completely . The FDCPA and similar provisions prohibit debt collectors from communicating or attempting to communicate with you if you notify them in writing that you want those communications to cease or that you refuse to pay the debt. The CFPB provides template letters that you can use to make such a request. (Debt collectors are technically still permitted under the law to collect the debt even if they can’t contact you, although that won’t always happen.) 3) Submit a complaint with the CFPB. If you have had a problem with a consumer financial product or service, including improper debt collection in the workplace, you can submit a complaint with the CFPB . The CFPB’s work in this area is part of our effort to protect consumers from shady contract terms that deny consumers their rights and economic freedoms. We are also working hard on other initiatives to protect people in the workplace. For example, the CFPB recently took action to curb unchecked surveillance activities that your employer may be subjecting you to. The CFPB has also highlighted the growing prevalence of employer-driven debt and challenges workers and consumers face when they become indebted to an employer as a condition of employment. The CFPB has taken enforcement action against multiple vocational schools that make false claims about hiring rates and deceive trainees about loans and their costs. The CFPB has also clarified when the Equal Credit Opportunity Act applies with respect to franchisees seeking credit to finance their businesses.

From 2015 to 2020, Performant used its control over the rehabilitation process to delay borrowers’ loan rehabilitations so that collection costs would be added to their loans. If borrowers in default called Performant to rehabilitate their loans within 65 days from default, Performant’s agents were instructed to do whatever they could to delay the borrowers’ rehabilitation until after 65 days had passed, allowing for the imposition of collection costs on the borrowers.

A redress payment compensates a consumer who has been wronged. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a U.S. government agency dedicated to making sure you’re treated fairly by banks, lenders, and other financial institutions. When we enforce the law, we or a court may order the company or person to take action to correct the harm caused to consumers. This can include requiring the company or person to compensate its victims through redress payments. These payments may be distributed directly by the company, through the CFPB’s Civil Penalty Fund, or by a payments administrator. In the case of CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, JND will be the third-party administrator that will process and issue checks to harmed consumers. How do I know if I’m part of the redress? Eligible consumers were identified as customers of CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law who were illegally charged upfront fees or were subjected to allegedly deceptive advertising. If you’re eligible for a payment, you’ll receive a letter and payment addressed to you. You don’t need to do anything. How are the payments calculated, and how much will I receive? The payments are calculated based on a pro-rata share of the fees you paid to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law. The amount you receive, however, may not cover all of the fees you paid. If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don’t need to take any additional action. How can I tell if my check is a scam? The CFPB never asks you to provide money and never charges you a fee to cash or receive a check. If someone asks you to send them money before or after cashing a check, it could be a scam. If you need to verify if your check is real, contact JND at (855) 680-8991 during business hours, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. You can also call the CFPB toll-free, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET, Monday to Friday, at (855) 411-CFPB (2372) or TTY/TDD (855) 729-CFPB (2372) . Please be patient and keep in mind that customer service wait times may be long due to the large number of check recipients. If I don’t receive a check, can I file a claim? No. There won’t be opportunities to file claims for this redress case. Will my payment be taxed? The check is considered a refund of payments you made to the defendants, so it’s unlikely to be taxable. If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor. Where can I cash my check? You can cash your check at any bank that you have a checking account with by signing the back of the check and depositing it through your online banking application, at your local bank branch by talking to a teller, or by using an ATM. Please keep in mind, sometimes deposits are not immediately available from your bank after depositing. Please check with your bank regarding check hold times. I do not have a bank account. Where can I cash my check? If you do not have a bank account, you can cash your CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law check at any domestic Wells Fargo banking branch for no fee. You need to talk to a Wells Fargo teller and show a valid ID that matches the name on your check. Alternatively, you can also take your check to any check-cashing service or to a supermarket or retail establishment that cashes checks.

www.consumerfinance.gov,2024-12-05,CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law refund checks: What you need to know,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/creditrepaircom-and-lexington-law-refund-checks-what-you-need-to-know/,"What is a redress payment, and who is sending it? A redress payment compensates a consumer who has been wronged. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a U.S. government agency dedicated to making sure you’re treated fairly by banks, lenders, and other financial institutions. When we enforce the law, we or a court may order the company or person to take action to correct the harm caused to consumers. This can include requiring the company or person to compensate its victims through redress payments. These payments may be distributed directly by the company, through the CFPB’s Civil Penalty Fund, or by a payments administrator. In the case of CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, JND will be the third-party administrator that will process and issue checks to harmed consumers. How do I know if I’m part of the redress? Eligible consumers were identified as customers of CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law who were illegally charged upfront fees or were subjected to allegedly deceptive advertising. If you’re eligible for a payment, you’ll receive a letter and payment addressed to you. You don’t need to do anything. How are the payments calculated, and how much will I receive? The payments are calculated based on a pro-rata share of the fees you paid to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law. The amount you receive, however, may not cover all of the fees you paid. If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don’t need to take any additional action. How can I tell if my check is a scam? The CFPB never asks you to provide money and never charges you a fee to cash or receive a check. If someone asks you to send them money before or after cashing a check, it could be a scam. If you need to verify if your check is real, contact JND at (855) 680-8991 during business hours, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. You can also call the CFPB toll-free, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET, Monday to Friday, at (855) 411-CFPB (2372) or TTY/TDD (855) 729-CFPB (2372) . Please be patient and keep in mind that customer service wait times may be long due to the large number of check recipients. If I don’t receive a check, can I file a claim? No. There won’t be opportunities to file claims for this redress case. Will my payment be taxed? The check is considered a refund of payments you made to the defendants, so it’s unlikely to be taxable. If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor. Where can I cash my check? You can cash your check at any bank that you have a checking account with by signing the back of the check and depositing it through your online banking application, at your local bank branch by talking to a teller, or by using an ATM. Please keep in mind, sometimes deposits are not immediately available from your bank after depositing. Please check with your bank regarding check hold times. I do not have a bank account. Where can I cash my check? If you do not have a bank account, you can cash your CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law check at any domestic Wells Fargo banking branch for no fee. You need to talk to a Wells Fargo teller and show a valid ID that matches the name on your check. Alternatively, you can also take your check to any check-cashing service or to a supermarket or retail establishment that cashes checks. Keep in mind that these companies charge fees for check cashing.

In both cases, you need to provide your Unique ID, name, and current address. Your Unique ID number can be found on your check or at the top of the letter that was mailed along with your check. If your address has changed, please provide your new address along with your previous address for verification purposes. If you need to have your name changed, submit a reissue request by email along with a copy of a government-issued ID displaying your current name and appropriate legal documentation – including a marriage license, divorce decree, or court order – indicating the name change.
